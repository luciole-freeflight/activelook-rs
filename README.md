# Binary de/serialization

## Deku
The `Deku` crate automatically offers the following:
- to_bytes / from_bytes
- try_from

We can specify a custom reader/writer for specific variants.

## binary_layout

**Not used**
Offers an in-place view of data, but this is very cumbersome to use.

## binrw

**Not used**
